The entire Simulation program consists of two components: Numerical Simulation, which is utilized for numerical simulation, 
and Simulation with Rotating Platform Model in Loop, which is used to verify the algorithm performance of the actual platform model in a loop.

I) Numerical Simulation Operation Process:
    1) Open 'Numerical_Simulation' folder.
    2) Open 'targeting_control_6.m' program.
    3) Perform parameter settings, including base position, target position, parameter gain, etc.
    4) Execute the simulation and present the results in graphic form. An avi format video will be generated to illustrate the estimated value and the change process of the direction.

II) Simulation with Rotating Platform Model in Loop Operation Process:
    1) Open 'Model_in_Loop_UE4' folder and launch  'aero.exe' program.
    2) Access 'acc_parameter_num6.m' to set parameters.
    3) Execute 'acc_num6.slx' program with a single key press.

Note: Embed  'aero.exe' program within a bat file and run it as an initial function in Simulink. The specific operations are outlined below:
    1) Open 'START_UE.txt', modify the address to the 'aero.exe' address on the user's computer, and convert the file to bat format after the modification.
    2) Open Simulink, access 'Model Property-Callbacks-initfcn*', and add '! START_UE'.
    3) Execute 'acc_num6.slx' program with a single key press.
