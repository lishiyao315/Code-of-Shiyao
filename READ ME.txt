The whole Simulation program consists of two parts, one of which is Numerical Simulation, which is used for numerical simulation. 
The other is Simulation with Rotating Platform Model in Loop, which is used to verify the algorithm performance of the actual platform model in loop.



Ⅰ) Numerical Simulation operation flow

    1) Open the Numerical_Simulation folder

    2) Open the targeting_control_6.m program

    3) Parameter setting, including base position, target position, parameter gain, etc

    4) Run, the simulation results are presented in figure form, and an avi format video is generated to show the estimated value and the change process of the direction



Ⅱ) Simulation with Rotating Platform Model in Loop operation process

    1) Open the Model_in_Loop_UE4 folder and run the aero.exe program

    2) Open acc_parameter_num6.m to set parameters

    3) Run acc_num6.slx program



Note: Run aero.exe through a bat file and embed it in simulink's intial function. Specific operations are as follows:

    1) Open START_UE.txt, change the address to the aero.exe address on the user's computer, and change the file to bat format after the change

    2) Open Simulink, open Model Property-Callbacks-initfcn *, and add '! START_UE'

    3) Run the acc_num6.slx program with one key
